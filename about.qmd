## About this blog 
This blog is to showcase the work I do in class as well as my thought process behind coding.

## About me
I am a senior Computer Science major at Middlebury College. I have experience in 
Python, C, OCaml, and Java, as well as the domain-specific language "NetLogo". 
I also like linguistics and art! Enjoy reading my blog and thank you for stopping by!
